# Word-Lerning (English)

AI-powered vocabulary memorization & translation practice. For users learning **any language** (French, Spanish, Japanese, German, etc.).

Generate authentic articles in your target language that seamlessly embed vocabulary words — with uncommon meanings, idiomatic collocations, and natural native-level writing.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Your Languages

```bash
python configure.py
```

You'll be asked:
- **Your native language** (e.g., English, Japanese, Spanish)
- **Language you're learning** (e.g., French, German, Korean)

This generates the skill files with your language pair embedded. Re-run anytime to change languages.

### 2. Install

```bash
# Windows
install.bat

# macOS / Linux
bash install.sh
```

The installer checks your config, generates skills if needed, and copies them to `~/.claude/skills/`.

### 3. Initialize Your Word List

In Claude Code:

```
/init-wordlist
```

Provide your word list file. The skill auto-detects the format, configures the regex, self-tests, and opens the web tool in your browser.

### 4. Triage Your Words

Browser opens to `http://localhost:8080/tools/word-triage/`:
- Load your word list file
- Click card to flip and see the definition
- `←` Unfamiliar / `→` Familiar / `Space` Flip / `↓` Skip
- Export `familiar.txt` and `unfamiliar.txt` → place in `data/`

### 5. Generate Articles

```
/generate-article
```

The skill uses your configured language pair automatically, then:
1. Extract 200 words (low-frequency first) from your unfamiliar list
2. Search authentic articles **in your target language**
3. **Run dedup check** against previously used articles
4. Rewrite the article, embedding target words naturally (uncommon meanings preferred)
5. Add translation exercises + vocabulary table + reading comprehension
6. Save the article and update word counters

## Troubleshooting

### UnicodeEncodeError (Windows)

```bash
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 python tools/extract-words.py ...
# or
chcp 65001
```

All scripts internally call `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')` — direct execution usually works. Only inline `python -c "..."` tests need the env var prefix.
